## R Projects

#### One Sample Means Z-Test
In *Aquatic Biology* (Vol. 9. 2010), a study was conducted on the green sea turtles inhabiting the Sound Lagoon of Grand Cayman. The carapace length (cm) was recorded from a sample of 76 green sea turtles. This project use z-tests to make inferences about the true mean carapace length of all turtles in Sound Lagoon. Get the code [here.](https://github.com/sretcher/z-test-turtles)

#### One Sample Inference for Population Variance
A study was conducted to learn about the effects of irrelevant speech on memorization (*Acoustical Science and Technology* Vol. 35, 2014). 71 subjects performed a memorization task under two conditions-with irrelevant background speech or silence. For each subject, the RDER (error between the two conditions as a percentage) was recorded. We will be using a one sample chi-squared test to see if the true standard deviation of the RDER measurements differs from 60 percent.

## JMP Projects

#### One Sample Means T-Test
A marine biologist believes that great white sharks off the coast of Bermuda grow much longer due to unusual feeding habits. Three adult great white sharks around Bermuda were captured to test this claim. We will use a t-test to see if the true mean length of great white shark around Bermuda is more than 21 feet, which is the average length of all great white sharks.

## SQL Projects

#### Hawaii Climate Data Analysis

This project analyzed temperature and precipitation trends of 34 diffrent [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/) weather stations in Hawaii from 2000-2019. Emphasis was placed on praticing database normalization, data cleaning, stored procedures, prepared statements, transactions, joins, unions, and pivot tables.

## Python Projects

#### Predicting Social Media Performance

This project examined the characteristics of 500 Facebook Posts from a renowned cosmetric brand in 2014 and attempts to predict the impact of a Facebook brand post with Multiple Linear Regression. This dataset is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) Get the code [here.](https://github.com/sretcher/facebook_metrics/blob/master/Facebook%20Metrics.ipynb)
