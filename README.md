## R Projects

### One Sample Means Z-Test
In *Aquatic Biology* (Vol. 9. 2010), a study was conducted on the green sea turtles inhabiting the Sound Lagoon of Grand Cayman. The carapace length (cm) was recorded from a sample of 76 green sea turtles. This project uses a z-test to estimate the true mean carapace length of all green sea turtles in the lagoon. Since the implementation of z-tests does not exist in R, we will attempt to recreate the project ourselves.

### Hawaii Climate Data Analysis

This project analyzed temperature and precipitation trends of 34 diffrent [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/) weather stations in Hawaii from 2000-2019. Emphasis was placed on praticing database normalization, data cleaning, stored procedures, prepared statements, transactions, joins, unions, and pivot tables.

### Predicting Social Media Performance

This project examined the characteristics of 500 Facebook Posts from a renowned cosmetric brand in 2014 and attempts to predict the impact of a Facebook brand post with Multiple Linear Regression. This dataset is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) Get the code [here.](https://github.com/sretcher/facebook_metrics/blob/master/Facebook%20Metrics.ipynb)
