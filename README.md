## R / JMP Projects

#### One Sample Means Z-Test
In *Aquatic Biology* (Vol. 9. 2010), a study was conducted on the green sea turtles inhabiting the Sound Lagoon of Grand Cayman. The carapace length (cm) was recorded from a sample of 76 green sea turtles. This project use z-tests to make inferences about the true mean carapace length of all turtles in Sound Lagoon. Get the code [here.](https://github.com/sretcher/z-test-turtles)

#### One Sample Means T-Test
A marine biologist believes that great white sharks off the coast of Bermuda grow much longer due to unusual feeding habits. Three adult great white sharks around Bermuda were captured to test this claim. We will use a t-test to see if the true mean length of great white shark around Bermuda is more than 21 feet, which is the average length of all great white sharks.

#### One Sample Chi-Square Test
A study was conducted to learn about the effects of irrelevant speech on memorization (*Acoustical Science and Technology* Vol. 35, 2014). 71 subjects performed a memorization task under two conditions-with irrelevant background speech or silence. For each subject, the RDER (error between the two conditions as a percentage) was recorded. We will be using a one sample chi-square test to see if the true standard deviation of the RDER measurements differs from 60 percent.

#### One Sample Proportion Test 
In a *Pew Internet and American Life Project Survey*, 755 randomly selected adults who use the Internet were asked if they have ever paid to access or download music. Of the 755 adults, 506 stated that they have paid for music. We will be using a one sample Z-test/Chi-Square Test of Independence to test whether the true porportion of all Internet using adults who have paid to access or download music exceeds .7.

#### Comparing Two Population Means: Independent Sampling
In the *Academy of Management Journal*, a study set out to investigate if rude behavior negatively affects work performance. Students in a management course were randomly seperated into two experimental conditions : rudeness (n=45) and control (n=53). Students were asked to write down as many uses for a brick as possible in five mintutes; this value would be a performance measure for each student. 

Students in the rudeness conditions were berated by the facilitator about being irresponsible and unproffesional because of a late-arriving confederate. In the control group, no comment was made about the late-arriving confederate. We will use a two sample z-test to see if the true mean performace level of the rudeness group is less than the true mean performance level for the control group.

#### Comparing Two Population Means: Independent Sampling (Small Samples)  
One experiment reported in *The American Statistician* wished to see whether women with eating disorders are more fearful of negative evaluation. One sample consisted of 11 students with bulimia and the other sample consisted of 14 students without an eating disorder. Each student completed a questionaire which resulted in a fear of negative evaluation (FNE) score. The higher the score, the greater the fear of negative evaluation. We will use a two sample t-test to see if the true mean FNE score for students with bulimia is higher than the true mean FNE score for people without an eating disorder.

#### Comparing Two Population Means: Paired Difference Experiments
To combat red-light-running crashes, many states are installing red light cameras at dangerous intersections. The Virginia Department of Transportation conducted a study in Fairfax County, Virginia to see if photo-red enforcement programs are effective in reducing red-light-running crashes at intersections. The study provides crash data (measured as the number of crashes caused by red light running per intersection per year) before and after installing red light cameras at 13 randomly selected intersections. We will use a one sample t-test on the sample of differences to see if the true mean number of crashes at at intersections with installed cameras is less than the true mean number of crashes at intersections without cameras.

## SQL Projects

#### Hawaii Climate Data Analysis

This project analyzed temperature and precipitation trends of 34 diffrent [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/) weather stations in Hawaii from 2000-2019. Emphasis was placed on praticing database normalization, data cleaning, stored procedures, prepared statements, transactions, joins, unions, and pivot tables.

## Python Projects

#### Predicting Social Media Performance

This project examined the characteristics of 500 Facebook Posts from a renowned cosmetric brand in 2014 and attempts to predict the impact of a Facebook brand post with Multiple Linear Regression. This dataset is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) Get the code [here.](https://github.com/sretcher/facebook_metrics/blob/master/Facebook%20Metrics.ipynb)
